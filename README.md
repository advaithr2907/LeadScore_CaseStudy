# Lead Score Case Study

PROBLEM STATEMENT

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The
company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once
these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the
course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address
or phone number, they are classified to be a lead.
The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each
of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance
and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
